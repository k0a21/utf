# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a basic static website project using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no build tools or frameworks. The project is currently in a skeleton state with empty core files ready for implementation.

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file (currently empty)
- `style.css` - CSS stylesheet (currently empty) 
- `script.js` - JavaScript file (currently empty)
- `hero.JPG` - Hero image asset (928x1232 JPEG)

## Development Approach

Since this is a static website with no build process:

- **No build commands** - Files can be edited directly and opened in browser
- **No package management** - No npm, yarn, or other dependency managers
- **No testing framework** - Manual testing by opening files in browser
- **No linting/formatting** - Consider browser developer tools for debugging

## Development Workflow

1. Edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files directly
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to test changes
3. Use browser developer tools for debugging and testing

## Assets

- Hero image available at `hero.JPG` for use in the website design
- Image dimensions: 928x1232 pixels (portrait orientation)

## Current State

All core implementation files (HTML, CSS, JS) are empty placeholders. The project needs initial implementation to become functional.
